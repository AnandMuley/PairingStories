  <p class="lead">
      Pairing rounds are crucial in the hiring process.
      I observed that we tend to take printouts of the stories when we want to share it with the
      candidate. Once the pairing is done we generally misplace the stories page. Hence we take
      printouts again. It leads to wastage of paper. To save environment and paper I wanted to
      digitize this process. Moreover sharing stories with hiring panels over email or shared drive
      means logging into the drive opening a story. Taking printout etc. Such a headache. If we want
      to update a story which has a typo or some other thing then it should be shared to everyone.
